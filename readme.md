The `.` creates a new Django app inside the *CURRENT* folder. Otherwise, it creates a new folder. 

<!-- For instance, if you did `rails new scribble` it would create a `scribble` folder and put the Rails app inside there. -->

> This is how a lot of people end up with a `scribble` folder inside another `scribble` folder.

## Specifications

### Models + Migrations

1. Create [models](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-48/django-models#models) for Post and Comment
2. Create [migrations](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-48/django-models#migrations) for Post and Comment

We will start off with two models: `Post` and `Comment`.

A `Post` should have an `author`, `title`, and `body` (these can all be `CharField`s). A `Comment` should have an `author`, `body`, and a `post`. The `author` and `body` model attributes can be `CharField`s but `post` should be a `ForeignKey`.
